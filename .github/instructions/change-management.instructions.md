Always make changes from the main/master branch. Once requested to make changes, ensure you are on the main/master branch before making any edits. Create a new branch for your changes, and do not make edits directly on the main/master branch. After making your changes, create a pull request to merge your changes into the main/master branch. This ensures that all changes are tracked and can be reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.
